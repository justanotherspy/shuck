#
# Multi-stage build producing a tiny, static, non-root image.
#
# The base images are Chainguard's (minimal, low/zero-CVE, continuously rebuilt).
# They are pinned by digest (supply-chain integrity) and kept current by the
# `docker` Dependabot ecosystem (.github/dependabot.yml), which bumps the digest
# as :latest moves. Resolve the current digest manually with:
#
#   docker buildx imagetools inspect cgr.dev/chainguard/go:latest \
#     --format '{{.Manifest.Digest}}'

# ---- build stage ------------------------------------------------------------
# --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM keeps the toolchain native; we cross-compile to the
# requested TARGET* below, so no QEMU emulation is needed.
